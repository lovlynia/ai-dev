# Mini Research Assistant Agent — Take-Home Exercise

Thanks for taking the time to work through this. It's a small, deliberately
straightforward exercise meant to mirror the kind of work this role does day to
day: turning a researcher's ad-hoc questions into a small, reliable, AI-powered
tool. There are no trick questions and no clever algorithms required. We're more
interested in how you structure things and the trade-offs you reason about than
in volume of code.

**Time budget: ~2 hours.** If you run short on time, prioritize a working agent
and a working eval over polish, and use the README notes (Task 5) to describe
what you'd have done next.

## The scenario

A researcher has a small dataset of community programs (`data/programs.csv`) and
keeps asking questions about it in plain English: *"How many programs are in the
education sector?"*, *"What's the total budget?"*, and so on. You're building a
small agent that answers those questions by querying the data, and you're making
it reliable enough to trust and easy to evaluate.

The dataset is synthetic. Each row is a program with these columns:

| column | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `program_id` | text | e.g. `P001` |
| `program_name` | text | |
| `region` | text | Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, West, Southwest |
| `sector` | text | `health`, `education`, or `energy` |
| `year` | integer | 2019–2023 |
| `budget_usd` | integer | |
| `people_served` | integer | |
| `status` | text | active, completed, planned, cancelled |

## What's in the repo

```
data/programs.csv      ~150 rows of synthetic data (provided)
eval/questions.jsonl   ~10 question/expected-answer pairs (provided)
llm.py                 provider-agnostic LLM interface + an offline FakeLLM (provided)
tools.py               the query_data tool  -> YOU IMPLEMENT
agent.py               the agent loop        -> YOU IMPLEMENT
evaluate.py            the eval harness      -> YOU IMPLEMENT (the scorer)
requirements.txt       optional extras; the offline path needs only stdlib
```

### No API keys needed

`llm.py` ships a deterministic `FakeLLM` so the whole thing runs offline with no
keys and no cost. The agent talks to the `LLM` interface, never to a provider
directly. `FakeLLM` already knows how to handle the questions in the eval set, so
you can focus on the agent, the tool, and the harness. You should not need to
edit `FakeLLM`.

## Your tasks

1. **Implement the agent loop** in `agent.py` (`Agent.answer`). Given a question,
   let the LLM decide whether to call the `query_data` tool, run it, feed the
   result back, and return a final natural-language answer. The expected
   request/response JSON protocol is documented at the top of `agent.py`.

2. **Implement the tool** in `tools.py` (`query_data`). It runs a read-only SQL
   query against the data. Make it safe (SELECT-only) and make sure a bad query
   can't crash the agent. The CSV-to-SQLite loading is already done for you.

3. **Implement the scorer** in `evaluate.py` (`score_answer`) and run the harness.
   It should report a pass rate over `eval/questions.jsonl`. Note there are two
   kinds of question: `value` (the answer should contain an expected value) and
   `refusal` (questions the data can't answer, which the agent should decline).

4. **Add basic reliability.** Validate inputs, handle tool/parse errors, and
   retry the model call once before giving up. Keep the eval harness running even
   when an individual question fails.

5. **Write a short "Production notes" section** at the bottom of this README (a
   few bullets each is fine):
   - How would you swap `FakeLLM` for a real provider, and how would you keep the
     code provider-agnostic? (`llm.py` has a stub to point at.)
   - How would you evaluate and monitor reliability if this ran in a regulated,
     research environment?
   - Where would cost and latency come from, and how would you keep them in check?
   - What would move this from CSV to PostgreSQL, and how would you deploy it?
   - When (if ever) would you add a second agent?

## Running it

```bash
python evaluate.py                                          # run the eval harness
python agent.py "What is the total budget across all programs?"   # ask a single question
```

To switch providers later: `LLM_PROVIDER=fake` (default) or `LLM_PROVIDER=real`
(stub — intentionally not implemented).

## What we're looking for

Clear structure, sensible boundaries between the agent / tool / provider, honest
error handling, a meaningful eval, and thoughtful production notes. Working and
simple beats clever and fragile.

## Deliverables

- Working `agent.py`, `tools.py`, and `evaluate.py` (eval harness runs and reports
  a pass rate).
- The "Production notes" section below, filled in.

## Production notes

### Swapping `FakeLLM` for a real provider
I would swap the `FakeLLM` for a real provider like OpenAI. I would probably keep `agent.py` intact and have a `RealLLM` function handle the API call. This would allow the agent to know how to act without making `agent.py` dependent on a specific provider.

### Reliability, evaluation, and monitoring
I would evaluate the LLM by using a structured data-analysis process. I would start by testing whether it correctly understands the dataset's columns and what information they contain, then ask it increasingly specific questions about the data. I would also test it with questions about information that does not exist in the dataset to make sure it does not make up answers. From there, I would refine the prompts and continue testing the agent to make sure it stays focused on helping with the research task.

### Cost and latency
Cost and latency would mainly come from the LLM consuming tokens and from making multiple LLM calls. One way to reduce this would be to use an open-source model locally when appropriate, or reduce the number of times the LLM needs to be called. Right now the agent is limited to four rounds, but if more prompts or steps are added, the cost and latency could increase.

### Moving from CSV to PostgreSQL and deployment
I would move the data from CSV into PostgreSQL because it is better suited for larger amounts of structured data and would make it easier to organize and query the data based on a researcher's needs. SQL would also allow the agent to work with a much larger dataset than the current CSV setup.

### Adding a second agent
I would only add a second agent if there was a specific task that the first agent could not handle effectively. If the existing agent can handle the researcher's questions reliably, adding another agent could make the system more complicated and potentially increase cost and latency.

### A few risks 
I would change how I check for SELECT in tools.py because it currently can possibly pass SELECTED. It hasn't been tested, but I should be correct since it only checks for the first six letters.
